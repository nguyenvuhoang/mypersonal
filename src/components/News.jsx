                          Setting the environment to code is something that many new coders often ignore because it is quite cumbersome. But believe me, once installed, you will be very happy to code. The reason I choose Visual Studio Code as my editor is because it's free ðŸ˜³ , fully functional and trusted by many people from newbie to pro. Enough rambling, let's get to the main point.

                            <li><strong>Atom One Dark Theme</strong>: Atom theme for VSCode, much nicer than default theme. Code inspiration</li>
                            <li><strong>Auto Close Tag</strong>: Auto close tag in code HTML, JSX</li>
                            <li><strong>Auto Rename Tag</strong>: Automatically rename tags when coding HTML, JSX. Combined with Auto Close Tag will make a great duo</li>
                            <li><strong>Bookmarks</strong>: Highlight lines of code for easy searching. When your code is long, having to scroll up, scroll down to find and code is quite tiring. Now just mark the location, then you just need to point to that location and the editor will open right at the bookmark position.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bracket Pair Colorizer</strong>: Help distinguish the {} when it becomes too much</li>
                            <li><strong>Code Spelling Checker</strong>: Check spelling when coding (English only)</li>
                            <li><strong>EditorConfig</strong>: To run the .editorconfig file, which is very convenient, I will talk about this file below</li>
                            <li><strong>ES7 React/Redux/React-Native/JS snippets</strong>: Snippet for React, Redux</li>
                            <li><strong>ESLint:</strong> ESLint for editor</li>
                            <li><strong>GitLens</strong>: Manage code better with git, show file changers, commits, etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>html to JSX</strong>: Convert HTML to JSX</li>
                            <li><strong>Live Server</strong>: Make the server auto reload when the html code is static</li>
                            <li><strong>Material Icon Theme</strong>: Add theme icons for files and folders to help you identify files quickly</li>
                            <li><strong>Prettier</strong>: Format code beautiful and genuine</li>
                            <li><strong>SVG Viewer</strong>: View svg images on editor</li>
                            <li><strong>VSCode-styled-components</strong>: Highlight and auto-complete for styled-component like when coding on css file</li>

                          <p>And setting also has 2 ways of setting, 1 is setting by JSON file, 2 is by UI. Here, I set it up with a JSON file to make it easier to see. Create file <code>./vscode/settings.json</code>  in home directory</p>

                          <p>Add more <strong>recommended extension</strong> into workspace, so that when anyone opens the source code, VS Code will recommend installing these extensions. You need add more file <code>extensions.json</code> in folder <code>.vscode</code>. These are the extensions I just listed above, you just need to copy this file and put it in the source, the editor will display the <code>recommended extension</code>, no need to search for each one.</p>

                          When working in Teams, to unify extensions and settings among members, we should share the <code>.vscode</code> folder (just leave it in the source, don't put it in <code>.gitignore</code> ).

                          <p>If you do not know, <strong>EditorConfig</strong> was born to unify standards between different editors. For example, someone use <strong>indent</strong> as <strong>space</strong>, someone use <strong>tab</strong>; someone <strong>indent </strong>2, others 4. <strong>EditorConfig</strong> makes our code more consistent, readable and maintainable.</p>
                          <p>You create the file <code>.editorconfig</code> in the main directory of the project. Because we already have the <strong>Editor Config</strong> extension installed above, when we create this file, the browser will automatically receive these settings.</p>

                            , I just need to install a few more things and the project will be smooth. Please follow the steps below
                          </p>
                          <p>Create a <code>.env</code> file in the root directory and add this value to <code>EXTEND_ESLINT=true</code>. The purpose is to make it possible for us to add other linters to <strong>React</strong>.</p>
                          <p>Install the following package <code>npm i prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier -D</code></p>
                          <p>Add this script in <code>package.json</code> (scripts section). Here I use <strong>Typescript</strong> and maybe <strong>Javascript</strong>, so I set it as <code>js, jsx, ts, tsx</code></p>
                          
                          <SyntaxHighlighter language="json" style={dark} children={packageJsonString}/>

                          <p>With the above commands, we just need to <code>npm lint</code> and <strong>eslint</strong> will scan the entire project for errors, <code>npm lint:fix</code> will automatically fix the entire project. Similar to prettier</p>
                          
                          <p>Create the file <code>.prettierrc</code>. This file specifies the rules for <strong>Prettier</strong></p>
                          <SyntaxHighlighter language="json" style={dark} children={prettierString}/>

                          <p>Create a <code>.prettierignore</code> file. This file tells <strong>Prettier</strong> not to format at the paths specified here</p>
                          <SyntaxHighlighter language="ignore" style={dark} children={prettierignorgeString}/>
                          
                          <p>Create <code>.eslintrc</code> file. This file is intended to extend the <strong>ESLint</strong> React configuration to help catch errors on the terminal, if you have installed the <strong>ESLint</strong> extension, it will rely on this file to catch errors directly on the editor.</p>
                          <SyntaxHighlighter language="json" style={dark} children={eslintrcString}/>

                          <p>We have added some <strong>Prettier</strong> rules as entered in <code>.prettierrc</code> to <strong>ESLint</strong> so that <strong>ESLint</strong> catches errors in case we forget to format</p>

                            Most photographers love to shoot the unusual, and
                            you donâ€™t get much more unusual than These
                            Unprecedented Times. Right now everything counts as
                            out of the ordinary. There are a number of

                            Streets empty that are usually busy are remarkable

                              Most photographers find it hard to see interesting
                              pictures in places in which they are most
                              familiar. A trip somewhere new seems always
                              exactly what our photography needed, as shooting
                              away from home consistently inspires us to new
                              artistic heights.

                            Pretend everything is new and that you havenâ€™t seen
                            it before, and then you will be free to notice the
                            leading lines, the places where one edge meets
                            another in delightful geometric harmony, and how the
                            ordinary things in the kitchen are transformed when
                            the light is on or off.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The trick here is to look slowly, and then look
                            again. Take the time to look in detail and to look
                            at the same thing from different angles, with
                            different light, long lenses and wide lenses. Then
                            move to the left a bit. You may never feel the need
                            to leave the house again.

                            Just because we can't get out and about like we
                            normally would, doesnâ€™t mean we have to stop taking
                            pictures. Thereâ€™s still plenty you can do, provided
                            you're prepared to use some imagination. Here are a
                            few ideas to keep you shooting until normal life
                            resumes.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Most photographers love to shoot the unusual, and
                            you donâ€™t get much more unusual than These
                            Unprecedented Times. Right now everything counts as
                            out of the ordinary. There are a number of
                            remarkable things about these lockdown days that are
                            worth photographing now so we can remember them when
                            it is all over.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Streets empty that are usually busy are remarkable
                            and can evoke the sense of historical pictures from
                            before the invention of the motorcar. Other things
                            that are different at the moment will be queues to
                            get into stores and the lines marked out on the
                            floor to show how far apart we should be.

                              Most photographers find it hard to see interesting
                              pictures in places in which they are most
                              familiar. A trip somewhere new seems always
                              exactly what our photography needed, as shooting
                              away from home consistently inspires us to new
                              artistic heights.

                            Pretend everything is new and that you havenâ€™t seen
                            it before, and then you will be free to notice the
                            leading lines, the places where one edge meets
                            another in delightful geometric harmony, and how the
                            ordinary things in the kitchen are transformed when
                            the light is on or off.

                            again. Take the time to look in detail and to look
                            at the same thing from different angles, with
                            different light, long lenses and wide lenses. Then
                            move to the left a bit. You may never feel the need
                            to leave the house again.
